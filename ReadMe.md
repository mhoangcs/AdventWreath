**AdventWreath** is a simple and easy-to-use script that displays a festive wreath on your website, blog, or any online space where you want to observe the season of Advent.  This wreath includes five candles: 

1.	Purple	(First Sunday of Advent)
2.	Purple	(Second Sunday)
3.	Rose	(Third Sunday)
4.	Purple	(Fourth Sunday)
5.	White	(Christmas Day) 

AdventWreath uses the current datetime to determine when Advent starts in your time zone, and each Sunday until Christmas, it "lights" the next Advent candle in the wreath. 

Please see *ReadMe.txt* for detailed instructions.
